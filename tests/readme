Tests for the face detection functionality.

This module contains unit tests for the face detection functionality implemented in the `face_detection` module.


This module contains unit tests for the face detection video functionality.

The tests cover the following scenarios:
- Successful video capture and face detection
- Failure to capture video
- Quitting the video capture by pressing the 'q' key

The tests use the `unittest.mock` module to patch the necessary OpenCV functions and simulate the expected behavior.
